          <h3>East Van Roasters is a non-profit initiative benefiting the women residents of the Rainier Hotel.</h3>
          <img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/images/pep/peer-employment-program.png" alt="A picture of several women attend peer employment program">
          <p>Since East Van Roasters opened in 2013, roughly 25 women have come through the program. 
            A lot of the women have expressed that having the opportunity to work here has boosted their confidence. They feel comfortable doing other things in their lives they maybe wouldnâ€™t have. Hearing stories of people moving onto full-time employment elsewhere, and going back to school, and moving on and living forward feels like the peer emplyment program is really fulfilling the purpose that it was meant to.</p>
          <p>We are a fully registered charity and would love to have your support!
